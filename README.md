DNA to Protein:

Input a DNA string
ex: AGGCCTTAATACCCCAATGGTAGTTTTCCGAACGGAATGGTAATCCCCTTATCTATCCGGTAAATC

Output:
Gly-Leu-Pro-Ser-Lys-Gly-Leu-Pro-Tyr-His

**Input must include:**
TAC somewere in the DNA. This is were it will start converting. Nothing before will be included in the final protein.
ATT or ATC or ACT at the end so it knows where to stop. After this nothing more will be read.

Without a start kodon nothing is included in the final protein.
Without a end kodon the protein will end at the end of the DNA.
